    <h2>New Features</h2>
    <p>In the context menu, SBMLsqueezer now remembers the rate law when
    switching the reaction from reversible to irreversible and automatically
    selects the corresponding equation if available.</p>    
    <h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
    <p>In the Hill equation instead of inhibitors SBMLsqueezer accessed 
    the list of activators to create an inhibition term.
    </p>
    <p>When trying to remove unnecessary parameters from the model, 
    SBMLsqueezer 1.2 deleted parameters, whose ids contain upper case
    letters, no matter if these occur in kinetic equations because of 
    an incorrect String comparison.</p>
    <p>The thermodynamically independent convenience kinetics was not
    created correctly in SBMLsqueezer 1.2: the integer one was substracted
    in the denominator in cases where this was incorrect and the parameter
    kV was not multiplied with the formula.</p>
