    <h2>New Features</h2>
    <p>SBMLsqueezer now automatically checks for updates. If a newer version 
    of SBMLsqueezer is available online, the user is notified by a message
    window in the bottom right corner of the screen. Furthermore, the
    release notes of the most recent SBMLsqueezer version are shown to the
    user by clicking on &#8220;show release notes&#8221;.</p>
    <p>In contrast to previous versions, SBMLsqueezer now indicates
    if a model already contains rate equations for all reactions or no
    reactions at all. In earlier versions SBMLsqueezer did not overwrite
    existing kinetic equations and did also not state why.</p>
    <p>SBMLsqueezer's complete internal data structure was improved:
    It has become much more efficient and simpler.</p>
    
    <h2>Improved Adaptation of SBMLsqueezer to CellDesigner 4.0.1</h2>
    <p>Due to the changes in CellDesigner, SBMLsqueezer only offered
    zeroth order mass action kinetics as available option to model
    transcription and translation processes. The reason for this was that
    the arrows for transcriptional/translational activation disappeared.
    These effects have now to be covered by trigger and physical
    stimulation. Unfortunately, CellDesigner maps the old arrows for
    transcriptional/translational activation to catalysis instead of
    &#8220;trigger&#8221;. Therefore, we also have to cover the case of having
    a transcription or translation &#8220;catalyzed&#8221; by some
    stimulator. This has now been implemented and SBMLsqueezer therefore
    offers several kinetic rate equations for both processes. The same holds
    true for the &#8220;batch&#8221; mode of SBMLsqueezer: besides
    transcriptional/translational activators also all kinds of catalysts and
    activators/inhibitors are accepted for the Hill equation.</p>
    <p>We now apply the inhibition pre-factor from convenience
    kinetics also to reversible Michaelis-Menten kinetics with multiple 
    inhibitors. In cases where the formulas of Michaelis-Menten and 
    convenience kinetics are equal, only one of both is offered to the
    user:<ul>
      <li>For reversible or irreversible uni-uni reactions without 
      inhibition or activation only the Michaelis-Menten equation is 
      selectable and</li>
      <li>in the case of reversible uni-uni reactions with multiple inhibitors
      only convenience kinetics can be applied.</li>
      <li>However, if the stoichiometric matrix of the reaction system does 
      not have a full column rank, the thermodynamically independen form
      of the convenience kinetics can be selected as an alternative
      to the Michaelis-Menten equation.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>Additionally, the activation pre-factor is now also applied for the
    mixed-type inhibition of irreversible enzymes by mutually exclusive 
    inhibitors (SBO:0000275) if activators are assigned to the reaction.
    </p>
    <p>The new SBGN representation of transcription and translation uses
    the trigger symbol (for the gene or the RNA molecule, depending on the
    process) and a reaction from some source to RNA or from some source to a
    protein. SBMLsqueezer did in these cases not suggest the Hill equation
    as a possible rate law because it still required the
    translation/transcription arrows that are going to be deprecated. Since
    this version, SBMLsqueezer also produces the identical form of the
    Hill equation for the old style of transcription/translation reaction
    and the new SBGN compliant form.</p>

    <h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
    <p>Local parameters could not be removed completely if not necessary
    (this happened only in SBMLsqueezer version 1.1 because SBMLsqueezer
    version 1.0 did not create or delete local parameters at all).</p>
    <p>In Michaelis-Menten kinetics activators were multiplied
    incorectly (only in the preview, not in the equation itself)</p>
    <p>The help browser could not be started in SBMLsqueezer version 1.1
    because of a null pointer exception (an image could not be loaded
    correctly).</p>
    <p>Problems of the &#8220;batch mode&#8221;:
    <ul>
      <li>In some cases SBMLsqueezer did not show the correct SBO numbers 
      (for &#8220;Hill equation&#8221; and &#8220;Henri-Michaelis-Menten 
      equation&#8221;).</li>
      <li>In the kinetics summary table SBMLsqueezer did not list the 
      kG parameters of the thermodynamically independent convenience 
      kinetics in the column &#8220;parameters&#8221;.</li>
      <li>Sometimes there was a problem with the equation preview.</li>
    </ul>
