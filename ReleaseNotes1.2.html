<h1>Release Notes of SBMLsqueezer version 1.2</h1>
<h2>New features</h2>
<p>SBMLsqueezer now checks for updates. If a newer version of
SBMLsqueezer is available online, the user is notified by a message
window in the bottom right corner of the screen. Furthermore, the
release notes of the most recent SBMLsqueezer version are shown to the
user by clicking on "show release notes".</p>
<h2>Adaptation of SBMLsqueezer to CellDesigner 4.0.1</h2>
<p>Due to the changes in CellDesigner SBMLsqueezer only showed
zeroth order mass action kinetics as available option to model
transcription and translation processes. The reason for this was that
the arrows for transcriptional/translational activation dissappeared.
These effects have now to be covered by trigger and physical
stimulation. Unfortunately, CellDesigner maps the old arrows for
transcriptional/translational activation to catalysis instead of
&ldquo;trigger&rdquo;. Therefore we have to also cover the case to have
a transcription or translation &ldquo;catalyzed&rdquo; by some
stimulator. This has now been implemented and SBMLsqueezer therefore
offers several kinetic rate equations for both processes. The same holds
true for the &ldquo;batch&rdquo; mode of SBMLsqueezer: besides
transcriptional/translational activators also all kinds of catalysts and
activators/inhibitors are accepted for the Hill equation.</p>
<h2>Bugs that were fixed</h2>
<p>Local parameters could not be removed completely if not necessary
(this happened only in SBMLsqueezer version 1.1 because SBMLsqueezer
version 1.0 did not create or delete local parameters at all).</p>
<p>The new SBGN representation of transcription and translation uses
the trigger symbol (for the gene or the RNA molecule, depending on the
process) and a reaction from some source to RNA or from some source to a
protein. SBMLsqueezer did in these cases not suggest the Hill equation
as a possible rate law because it still required the
translation/transcription arrows that are going to be deprecated.</p>
<p>preview of Michaelis-Menten kinetics: activators were multiplied
incorectly (only in the preview, not in the equation itself)</p>
<p>The help browser could not be started in SBMLsqueezer version 1.1
because of a null pointer exception (an image could not be loaded
correctly).</p>
<p>In some cases the &ldquo;batch mode&rdquo; of SBMLsqueezer did
not show the correct SBO numbers (for &ldquo;Hill equation&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Henri-Michaelis-Menten equation&dquo;).</p>
