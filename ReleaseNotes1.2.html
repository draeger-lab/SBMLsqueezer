      local parameters could not be removed completely if not necessary

      preview of Michaelis-Menten kinetics: activators were multiplied
      incorectly (only in the preview, not in the equation itselve)
    </p>
    <p> 
      Due to the changes in CellDesigner SBMLsqueezer only showed
      zeroth order mass action kinetics as available option to model
      transcription and translation processes. The reason for this was
      that the arrows for transcriptional/translational activation
      dissappeared. These effects have now to be covered by trigger and
      physical stimulation. Unfortunately, CellDesigner maps the old
      arrows for transcriptional/translational activation to catalysis
      instead of &ldquo;trigger&rdquo;. Therefore we have to also cover 
      the case to have a transcription or translation &ldquo;catalyzed&rdquo;
      by some stimulator. This has now been implemented and SBMLsqueezer
      therefore offers several kinetic rate equations for both processes.
      The same holds true for the &ldquo;batch&rdquo; mode of SBMLsqueezer:
      besides transcriptional/translational activators also all kinds of
      catalysts and activators/inhibitors are accepted for the Hill equation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In some cases the &ldquo;batch mode&rdquo; of SBMLsqueezer did not
      show the correct SBO numbers (for &ldquo;Hill equation&rdquo; and 
      &ldquo;Henri-Michaelis-Menten equation&dquo;).
