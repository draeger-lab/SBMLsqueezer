    <h1>Release Notes of SBMLsqueezer version 1.2</h1>
    <h2>New features</h2>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h2>Adaptation of SBMLsqueezer to CellDesigner 4.0.1</h2>
    <p> 
      Due to the changes in CellDesigner SBMLsqueezer only showed
      zeroth order mass action kinetics as available option to model
      transcription and translation processes. The reason for this was
      that the arrows for transcriptional/translational activation
      dissappeared. These effects have now to be covered by trigger and
      physical stimulation. Unfortunately, CellDesigner maps the old
      arrows for transcriptional/translational activation to catalysis
      instead of &ldquo;trigger&rdquo;. Therefore we have to also cover 
      the case to have a transcription or translation &ldquo;catalyzed&rdquo;
      by some stimulator. This has now been implemented and SBMLsqueezer
      therefore offers several kinetic rate equations for both processes.
      The same holds true for the &ldquo;batch&rdquo; mode of SBMLsqueezer:
      besides transcriptional/translational activators also all kinds of
      catalysts and activators/inhibitors are accepted for the Hill equation. 
    </p>
    <h2>Bugs that were fixed</h2>
    <p>
      Local parameters could not be removed completely if not necessary
      (this happened only in SBMLsqueezer version 1.1 because SBMLsqueezer
      version 1.0 did not create or delete local parameters at all).
    </p>
    <p>
      preview of Michaelis-Menten kinetics: activators were multiplied
      incorectly (only in the preview, not in the equation itself)
    </p>
    <p>
      The help browser could not be started in SBMLsqueezer version 1.1
      because of a null pointer exception (an image could not be loaded
      correctly).
    </p>
    <p>
      In some cases the &ldquo;batch mode&rdquo; of SBMLsqueezer did not
      show the correct SBO numbers (for &ldquo;Hill equation&rdquo; and 
      &ldquo;Henri-Michaelis-Menten equation&dquo;).
