    <p>The Program SBMLsqueezer is a generator for kinetic equations in biochemical
    networks. Its internal data structure is based on the Systems Biology Markup
    Language (SBML) and its Java&trade; implementation JSBML.</p>
    <p>SBMLsqueezer automatically recognizes the type and structure of reactions
    and discriminates between several different forms of modulation, including
    inhibition, activation, or catalysis. To this end, SBMLsqueezer interprets
    model annotations, e.g., Systems Biology Ontology (SBO) terms, or
    annotations from the program known as CellDesigner.</p>
    <p>SBMLsqueezer is a very versatile program that can be used in multiple
    ways, e.g., as a rate law generating core in third-party applications, as
    a stand-alone program, as a plug-in for the program CellDesigner, or as a
    Garuda gadget.</p>
    <p>This application programming interface (API) documentation should help
    you to understand how SBMLsqueezer works and how you can use it in your
    software.</p>
