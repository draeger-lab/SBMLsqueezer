The tool SBMLsqueezer facilitates the task of assigning kinetic equations to
reactions within biochemical network models that are given in \acs{SBML} format.
It analyzes each reaction of interest, selects applicable equations, and derives
appropriate units of all parameters contained in these equations.
If possible, components that SBMLsqueezer adds to your model are annotated with
\ac{SBO} and \ac{MIRIAM} tags.
Besides \emph{de-novo} creation of rate equations, SBMLsqueezer also offers
online access to the reaction kinetics database \ac{SABIO-RK}, where you can extract
experimentally determined rate laws for your model.
In both modes (\emph{de-novo} creation and database lookup), you can assign kinetic equations to all reactions of the model in
one single step, or select individual reactions of interest. 
Several settings allow you to customize the behavior of the program.
In particular, all choices made by SBMLsqueezer can be changed or influenced.
The program can be used in multiple ways: as a plug-in for the programm
CellDesigner, as a gadget for Garuda, as a stand-alone tool via its graphical
user interface, or as a command-line based tool.
Furthermore, the application programming interface allows you to integrate
SBMLsqueezer as an equation generating core into your end-user application.
An export function based on the integrated program \SBMLLaTeXs{} allows you to
generate an exhaustive model report for scientific writing or further
processing.
