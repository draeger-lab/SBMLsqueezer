  Abstract                 = {The Calvin-Benson cycle (CBC) provides the precursors for biomass synthesis necessary for plant growth. The dynamic behavior and yield of the CBC depend on the environmental conditions and regulation of the cellular state. Accurate quantitative models hold the promise of identifying the key determinants of the tightly regulated CBC function and their effects on the responses in future climates. We provide an integrative analysis of the largest compendium of existing models for photosynthetic processes. Based on the proposed ranking, our framework facilitates the discovery of best-performing models with regard to metabolomics data and of candidates for metabolic engineering.},

  Abstract                 = {Background
Systems biology projects and omics technologies have led to a growing number of biochemical pathway models and reconstructions. However, the majority of these models are still created de novo, based on literature mining and the manual processing of pathway data.
Results
To increase the efficiency of model creation, the Path2Models project has automatically generated mathematical models from pathway representations using a suite of freely available software. Data sources include KEGG, BioCarta, MetaCyc and SABIO-RK. Depending on the source data, three types of models are provided: kinetic, logical and constraint-based. Models from over 2 600 organisms are encoded consistently in SBML, and are made freely available through BioModels Database at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/path2models. Each model contains the list of participants, their interactions, the relevant mathematical constructs, and initial parameter values. Most models are also available as easy-to-understand graphical SBGN maps.
Conclusions
To date, the project has resulted in more than 140 000 freely available models. Such a resource can tremendously accelerate the development of mathematical models by providing initial starting models for simulation and analysis, which can be subsequently curated and further parameterized.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: The Biological Pathway Exchange Language (BioPAX) and the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) belong to the most popular modeling and data exchange languages in systems biology. The focus of SBML is quantitative modeling and dynamic simulation of models, whereas the BioPAX specification concentrates mainly on visualization and qualitative analysis of pathway maps. BioPAX describes reactions and relations. In contrast, SBML core exclusively describes quantitative processes such as reactions. With the SBML Qualitative Models extension (qual), it has recently also become possible to describe relations in SBML. Before the development of SBML qual, relations could not be properly translated into SBML. Until now, there exists no BioPAX to SBML converter that is fully capable of translating both reactions and relations.
Results: The entire Nature Pathway Interaction Database (PID) has been converted from BioPAX (Level 2 and Level 3) into SBML (Level 3 Version 1) including both reactions and relations by using the new qual extension package. Additionally, we present the new webtool BioPAX2SBML for further BioPAX to SBML conversions. Compared to previous conversion tools, BioPAX2SBML is more comprehensive, more robust and more exact.

  Abstract                 = {The metabolism of living organisms consists of a complex network of chemical reactions that transform small molecules to gain energy and biomass from nutrients. In such a network, metabolic pathways represent regulated functional units for converting particular source metabolites into product molecules by a sequence of reactions. However, knowledge about pathways, especially in newly sequenced genomes, is incomplete or remains to be experimentally verified.
The potential presence of novel or alternative pathways has to be considered when investigating metabolic capabilities of organisms. In this context, computational inference of biologically meaningful pathways constitutes an attractive complement to experimental studies and has numerous applications in systems biology.
This thesis presents several novel computational approaches for analyzing metabolic pathways in genome-scale networks. A graph theoretical approach was developed that maps the metabolic network onto a weighted graph and uses an efficient path-finding algorithm to calculate relevant biotransformation routes.
The approach was complemented by the integration of further relevant information derived from the biochemical entities (metabolites, reactions and enzymes) that build up the network. For this purpose, an improved method was created that automatically calculates atom mapping rules from chemical structures of the network compounds. Given a chemical reaction, an atom mapping rule defines which atom of an educt compound is transferred to which atom of a product compound. The application of these rules allows one to trace the flow of atoms in the path search, which is useful for detecting biochemically unfeasible routes. A further method for estimating Gibbs energy changes of reactions under (biochemical) standard conditions was developed and used to improve the path search. The third method extended the pathway analysis using predicted information about subcellular localizations of the enzymes involved.
To demonstrate the usefulness of the developed approaches for metabolic pathway analysis, experimentally verified biotransformation routes in the metabolic networks of Escherichia coli and Arabidopsis thaliana were predicted.
In the last part of this thesis a user-friendly web interface, called MetaRoute, for exploring the metabolic networks for hundreds of organisms, is described.},

MathML is an XML application for describing mathematical notation and capturing both its structure and content. The goal of MathML is to enable mathematics to be served, received, and processed on the Web, just as HTML has enabled this functionality for text.
This specification of the markup language MathML is intended primarily for a readership consisting of those who will be developing or implementing renderers or editors using it, or software that will communicate using MathML as a protocol for input or output. It is not a User's Guide but rather a reference document.
This document begins with background information on mathematical notation, the problems it poses, and the philosophy underlying the solutions MathML proposes. MathML can be used to encode both mathematical notation and mathematical content. Twenty-eight of the MathML tags describe abstract notational structures, while another seventy-five provide a way of unambiguously specifying the intended meaning of an expression. Additional chapters discuss how the MathML content and presentation elements interact, and how MathML renderers might be implemented and should interact with browsers. Finally, this document addresses the issue of MathML entities (extended characters) and their relation to fonts.
While MathML is human-readable it is anticipated that, in all but the simplest cases, authors will use equation editors, conversion programs, and other specialized software tools to generate MathML. Several early versions of such MathML tools already exist, and a number of others, both freely available software and commercial products, are under development.},

Model structures, simulation descriptions and numerical results can be encoded in structured formats, but there is an increasing need to provide an additional semantic layer. Semantic information adds meaning to components of structured descriptions to help identify and interpret them unambiguously. Ontologies are one of the tools frequently used for this purpose. We describe here three ontologies created specifically to address the needs of the systems biology community. The Systems Biology Ontology (SBO) provides semantic information about the model components. The Kinetic Simulation Algorithm Ontology (KiSAO) supplies information about existing algorithms available for the simulation of systems biology models, their characterization and interrelationships. The Terminology for the Description of Dynamics (TEDDY) categorizes dynamical features of the simulation results and general systems behavior. The provision of semantic information extends a model's longevity and facilitates its reuse. It provides useful insight into the biology of modeled processes, and may be used to make informed decisions on subsequent simulation experiments.},

Due to the inconclusive information on the reversibility of the reactions in the pathway, we develop both a reversible and an irreversible differential equation model based on the recent convenience kinetics approach. As the reversible model allows better approximation on the whole, we use it to analyze the impact of different settings on four especially promising EAs.

  Abstract                 = {Background: To understand the dynamic behavior of cellular systems, mathematical modeling is often necessary and comprises three steps: (1) experimental measurement of participating molecules, (2) assignment of rate laws to each reaction, and (3) parameter calibration with respect to the measurements. In each of these steps the modeler is confronted with a plethora of alternative approaches, e. g., the selection of approximative rate laws in step two as specific equations are often unknown, or the choice of an estimation procedure with its specific settings in step three. This overall process with its numerous choices and the mutual influence between them makes it hard to single out the best modeling approach for a given problem.
Results: We investigate the modeling process using multiple kinetic equations together with various parameter optimization methods for a well-characterized example network, the biosynthesis of valine and leucine in C. glutamicum. For this purpose, we derive seven dynamic models based on generalized mass action, Michaelis-Menten and convenience kinetics as well as the stochastic Langevin equation. In addition, we introduce two modeling approaches for feedback inhibition to the mass action kinetics. The parameters of each model are estimated using eight optimization strategies. To determine the most promising modeling approaches together with the best optimization algorithms, we carry out a two-step benchmark: (1) coarse-grained comparison of the algorithms on all models and (2) fine-grained tuning of the best optimization algorithms and models. To analyze the space of the best parameters found for each model, we apply clustering, variance, and correlation analysis.
Conclusions: A mixed model based on the convenience rate law and the Michaelis-Menten equation, in which all reactions are assumed to be reversible, is the most suitable deterministic modeling approach followed by a reversible generalized mass action kinetics model. A Langevin model is advisable to take stochastic effects into account. To estimate the model parameters, three algorithms are particularly useful: For first attempts the settings-free Tribes algorithm yields valuable results. Particle swarm optimization and differential evolution provide significantly better results with appropriate settings.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years biology has shifted its focus from the mainly descriptive exploration of individual organisms, cells, or molecules towards a holistic investigation of the complex interactions within living systems. This progress is driven by the development of large-scale measurement techniques, e.g., the timely resolved simultaneous quantification of many cellular components. The exploration of these data sets requires the application of methods from other areas of natural science and the development of novel analysis methods. At this intersection systems biology aims to understand mutual interactions and influences between biological components. Control mechanisms and regulation of processes, which often show a nonlinear behavior, are to be described. Predicting the dynamics of complex interaction systems constitutes its main challenge.
Computational modeling methods play a central role to attain this goal. Without loss of generality, we here focus on metabolic systems in preparation for an extension to gene-regulatory systems. Physico-chemical, in particular thermodynamic, constraints restrict the investigated systems and define the domain of plausible and valid models. Setting up such a mathematical description is not only complicated and highly error-prone, it also requires knowledge from many different fields and is therefore not easily applicable for non-experts. This thesis aims at the development of a method that performs the model construction steps to the widest extent automatically, reducing the number of necessary human interactions to a minimum but that still leads to thermodynamically feasible and correct model systems.
To this end, it introduces a five-step modeling pipeline that ultimately leads to a mathematical description of a biochemical reaction system. We discuss how to automate each individual step and how to put these steps together: First, we create a topology of interconversion processes and mutual influences between reactive species encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) including semantic information. Second, a procedure is established that generates kinetic equations in a context-sensitive manner. The resulting model can then be combined with already existing models. Third, we estimate the values of all newly introduced parameters in each created rate law. This procedure requires that a time series of quantitative measurements of the reactive species within this system be available, because we calibrate the parameters with the aim that the model will fit these experimental data. The applicability and functioning of these approaches is demonstrated on a model of the valine and leucine biosynthesis in \emph{C.~glutamicum}. In a large-scale benchmark the results of seven modeling techniques are systematically compared when estimating their parameters with a multitude of nature-inspired heuristic optimization processes. This step is crucial for the development of an automatic modeling procedure because it highlights the strength and weaknesses of all these approaches. Fourth, an experimental validation of the resulting model is advisable. Fifth, a model report is generated automatically to document the model with all of its components.
In an extension, this computer-aided modeling pipeline is further developed to a fully automatic procedure, the AMUSE algorithm (Automated Modeling Using Specialized Enzyme kinetics). The network topology in form of an SBML file and biological reference data, i.e., at least one time-series of participating metabolite concentrations and some relevant target fluxes, build its only required input. Based on latest estimation methods for standard reaction Gibbs energies, AMUSE determines a thermodynamically feasible, minimal equilibrium configuration of the system, identifies the key reactions and selects kinetic equations describing all reaction velocities. Furthermore, it estimates all remaining parameters with respect to given experimental data.
For a better understanding, we begin with an introduction to fundamental modeling and generalized approaches for common rate equations. Subsequently, parameter estimation techniques are introduced and evaluated on the valine and leucine biosynthesis in \emph{C.~glutamicum}. Thereafter, standardization attempts in systems biology will be discussed that are required for the computer-aided modeling pipeline. This pipeline necessitates extending the existing standards. In particular, the development and implementation of JSBML, the Java library for SBML, has been conducted to simplify computation and manipulation of complex models. A discussion of possible further improvements and an extension of the suggested modeling pipeline to gene-regulatory networks completes this thesis.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: The development of complex biochemical models has been facilitated through the standardization of machine-readable representations like SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language). This effort is accompanied by the ongoing development of the human-readable diagrammatic representation SBGN (Systems Biology Graphical Notation). The graphical SBML editor CellDesigner allows direct translation of SBGN into SBML, and vice versa. For the assignment of kinetic rate laws, however, this process is not straightforward, as it often requires manual assembly and specific knowledge of kinetic equations.
Results: SBMLsqueezer facilitates exactly this modeling step via automated equation generation, overcoming the highly error-prone and cumbersome process of manually assigning kinetic equations. For each reaction the kinetic equation is derived from the stoichiometry, the participating species (e.g., proteins, mRNA or simple molecules) as well as the regulatory relations (activation, inhibition or other modulations) of the SBGN diagram. Such information allows distinctions between, for example, translation, phosphorylation or state transitions. The types of kinetics considered are numerous, for instance generalized mass-action, Hill, convenience and several Michaelis-Menten-based kinetics, each including activation and inhibition. These kinetics allow SBMLsqueezer to cover metabolic, gene regulatory, signal transduction and mixed networks. Whenever multiple kinetics are applicable to one reaction, parameter settings allow for user-defined specifications. After invoking SBMLsqueezer, the kinetic formulas are generated and assigned to the model, which can then be simulated in CellDesigner or with external ODE solvers. Furthermore, the equations can be exported to SBML, \LaTeX{} or plain text format.
Conclusion: SBMLsqueezer considers the annotation of all participating reactants, products and regulators when generating rate laws for reactions. Thus, for each reaction, only applicable kinetic formulas are considered. This modeling scheme creates kinetics in accordance with the diagrammatic representation. In contrast most previously published tools have relied on the stoichiometry and generic modulators of a reaction, thus ignoring and potentially conflicting with the information expressed through the process diagram.

  Abstract                 = {SUMMARY: The XML-based Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) has emerged as a standard for storage, communication and interchange of models in systems biology. As a machine-readable format XML is difficult for humans to read and understand. Many tools are available that visualize the reaction pathways stored in SBML files, but many components, e.g., unit declarations, complex kinetic equations or links to MIRIAM resources, are often not made visible in these diagrams. For a broader understanding of the models, support in scientific writing and error detection, a human-readable report of the complete model is needed. We present SBML2\LaTeX, a Java-based stand-alone program to fill this gap. A convenient web service allows users to directly convert SBML to various formats, including DVI, \LaTeX{} and PDF, and provides many settings for customization.

In contrast to prior implementations of SBML APIs, JSBML has been designed from the ground up for the Java\texttrademark{} programming language, and can therefore be used on all platforms supported by a Java Runtime Environment. This offers important benefits for Java users, including the ability to distribute software as Java Web Start applications. JSBML supports all SBML Levels and Versions through Level~3 Version~1, and we have strived to maintain the highest possible degree of compatibility with the popular library libSBML. JSBML also supports modules that can facilitate the development of plugins for end-user applications, as well as ease migration from a libSBML-based backend.

In addition to specifying the model as a set of equations, many modern modelling tools allow the user to create and to interact with the model in the form of a reaction graph. Unfortunately, the SBML file format does not provide for the storage of this graph data along with the mathematical description of the model. Results: Therefore, we developed an extension to the SBML file format that makes it possible to store such layout information which describes position and size of objects in the graphical representation.

Such tools are needed at each step of a systems biology computational workflow, which typically consists of data handling, network inference, deep curation, dynamical simulation and model analysis. In addition, there are now efforts to develop integrated software platforms, so that tools that are used at different stages of the workflow and by different researchers can easily be used together. This Review describes the types of software tools that are required at different stages of systems biology research and the current options that are available for systems biology researchers. We also discuss the challenges and prospects for modelling the effects of genetic changes on physiology and the concept of an integrated platform.},

During the last decade, many systems biological approaches that base on genome-wide data have been developed to unravel the complexity of gene regulation. This review deals with the reconstruction of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from experimental data through computational methods. Standard GRN inference methods primarily use gene expression data derived from microarrays. However, the incorporation of additional information from heterogeneous data sources, e.g. genome sequence and protein-DNA interaction data, clearly supports the network inference process. This review focuses on promising modelling approaches that use such diverse types of molecular biological information. In particular, approaches are discussed that enable the modelling of the dynamics of gene regulatory systems. The review provides an overview of common modelling schemes and learning algorithms and outlines current challenges in GRN modelling.},

Currently, a variety of modelling approaches for specific purposes coexists. P systems form such an approach which owing to its algebraic nature opens growing fields of application. Here, emulating the dynamical system behaviour based on reaction kinetics is of particular interest to explore network functions. We demonstrate a transformation of Hill kinetics for gene regulatory networks (GRNs) into the P systems framework. Examples address the switching dynamics of GRNs acting as inverter, NAND gate, and RS flip-flop. An adapted study in vivo experimentally verifies both practicability for computational units and validity of the system model.}

  Abstract                 = {With the rise of Systems Biology as a new paradigm for understanding biological processes, the development of quantitative models is no longer restricted to a small circle of theoreticians. The dramatic increase in the number of these models precipitates the need to exchange and reuse both existing and newly created models. The Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) is a free, open, XML-based format for representing quantitative models of biological interest that advocates the consistent specification of such models and thus facilitates both software development and model exchange.
Principally oriented towards describing systems of biochemical reactions, such as cell signalling pathways, metabolic networks and gene regulation etc., SBML can also be used to encode any kinetic model. SBML offers mechanisms to describe biological components by means of compartments and reacting species, as well as their dynamic behaviour, using reactions, events and arbitrary mathematical rules. SBML also offers all the housekeeping structures needed to ensure an unambiguous understanding of quantitative descriptions.
This is Release 1 of the specification for SBML Level 2 Version 4, describing the structures of the language and the rules used to build a valid model. SBML XML Schema and other related documents and software are also available from the SBML project web site, http://sbml.org/.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) Level 1, Version 2, a description language for simulations in systems biology. SBML is oriented towards representing biochemical networks common in research on a number of topics, including cell signaling pathways, metabolic pathways, biochemical reactions, gene regulation, and many others. A recent conference (Kitano, 2001) highlights the range of topics that fall under the umbrella of systems biology and are in the domain of the description language defined here. Many contemporary research initiatives demonstrate the growing popularity of this kind of multidisciplinary work (e.g., Abbott, 1999; Gilman, 2000; Popel and Winslow, 1998; Smaglik, 2000a,b). SBML Level 1 is the result of merging modeling-language features from the following simulation systems: BioSpice (Arkin, 2001), DBSolve (Goryanin, 2001; Goryanin et al., 1999), E-Cell (Tomita et al., 1999, 2001), Gepasi (Mendes, 1997, 2001), Jarnac (Sauro, 2000; Sauro and Fell, 1991), StochSim (Bray et al., 2001; Morton-Firth and Bray, 1998), and Virtual Cell (Schaff et al., 2000, 2001). SBML was developed with the help of the authors of these packages. As a result of being based on actual working simulation software, it is a practical and functional description language. Our goal in creating it has been to provide an open standard that will enable simulation software to exchange models, something that is currently impossible because there is no standard model exchange language. We expect SBML models to be encoded using XML, the eXtensible Markup Language (Bosak and Bray, 1999; Bray et al., 1998), and we include here an XML Schema that defines SBML Level 1.}

Since its launch in 2005, the system has evolved in terms of the structure of the identifiers provided, the software infrastructure, the number of data collections recorded, as well as the scope of the Registry itself. We describe here the new parallel identification scheme and the updated supporting software infrastructure. We also introduce the new Identifiers.org service (http://identifiers.org) that is built upon the information stored in the Registry and which provides directly resolvable identifiers, in the form of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs).

The higher order functional information is stored in the PATHWAY database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The PATHWAY database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in KEGG is LIGAND for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions. KEGG provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation. The KEGG databases are daily updated and made freely available (http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/ ).},

  Abstract                 = {Background: With the increasing availability of high dimensional time course data for metabolites, genes, and fluxes, the mathematical description of dynamical systems has become an essential aspect of research in systems biology. Models are often encoded in formats such as SBML, whose structure is very complex and difficult to evaluate due to many special cases.
Results: This article describes an efficient algorithm to solve SBML models that are interpreted in terms of ordinary differential equations. We begin our consideration with a formal representation of the mathematical form of the models and explain all parts of the algorithm in detail, including several preprocessing steps. We provide a flexible reference implementation as part of the Systems Biology Simulation Core Library, a community-driven project providing a large collection of numerical solvers and a sophisticated interface hierarchy for the definition of custom differential equation systems. To demonstrate the capabilities of the new algorithm, it has been tested with the entire SBML Test Suite and all models of BioModels Database.
Conclusions: The formal description of the mathematics behind the SBML format facilitates the implementation of the algorithm within specifically tailored programs. The reference implementation can be used as a simulation backend for Java-based programs.

The identification of suitable model parameters for biochemical reactions has been recognized as a quite difficult endeavor. Parameter values from literature or experiments can often not directly be combined in complex reaction systems. Nature-inspired optimization techniques can find appropriate sets of parameters that calibrate a model to experimentally obtained time series data.
Results
We present SBMLsimulator, a tool that combines the Systems Biology Simulation Core Library for dynamic simulation of biochemical models with the heuristic optimization framework EvA2. SBMLsimulator provides an intuitive graphical user interface with various options as well as a fully-featured command-line interface for large-scale and script-based model simulation and calibration.

In order to enable interoperability of this annotation, the community has to agree on a set of standard URIs, corresponding to recognised data types. MIRIAM Resources are being developed to support the use of those URIs.
Results: MIRIAM Resources are a set of on-line services created to catalogue data types, their URIs and the corresponding physical URLs (or resources), whether data types are controlled vocabularies or primary data resources. MIRIAM Resources are composed of several components: MIRIAM Database stores the information, MIRIAM Web Services allows to programmatically access the database, MIRIAM Library provides an access to the Web Services and MIRIAM Web Application is a way to access the data (human browsing) and also to edit or add entries.
Conclusions: The project MIRIAM Resources allows an easy access to MIRIAM URIs and the associated information and is therefore crucial to foster a general use of MIRIAM annotations in computational models of biological processes.},

This standard lists the condition an encoded model has to meet to fully correspond to its reference description, and describe how to annotate each of its components. The Systems Biology Ontology (SBO) aims to strictly index, define and relate terms used in quantitative modelling, and by extension quantitative biochemistry. SBO is currently made up of five different vocabularies: quantitative parameters, participant roles, modelling frameworks, mathematical expressions � that refers to the three previous branches � and events. SBO can be used not only to annotate quantitative models, but also biochemical experiements. It is expected that the adoption of those two semantic layers will favour the reusability of quantitative biochemical descriptions, whether parameters or models.},

Toward this goal, we present the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN), a visual language developed by a community of biochemists, modelers and computer scientists. SBGN consists of three complementary languages: process diagram, entity relationship diagram and activity flow diagram. Together they enable scientists to represent networks of biochemical interactions in a standard, unambiguous way.

  Abstract                 = {Quantitative models of biochemical and cellular systems are used to answer a variety of questions in the biological sciences. The number of published quantitative models is growing steadily thanks to increasing interest in the use of models as well as the development of improved software systems and the availability of better, cheaper computer hardware. To maximise the benefits of this growing body of models, the field needs centralised model repositories that will encourage, facilitate and promote model dissemination and reuse. Ideally, the models stored in these repositories should be extensively tested and encoded in community-supported and standardised formats. In addition, the models and their components should be cross-referenced with other resources in order to allow their unambiguous identification.
BioModels Database \url{http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/} is aimed at addressing exactly these needs. It is a freely-accessible online resource for storing, viewing, retrieving, and analysing published, peer-reviewed quantitative models of biochemical and cellular systems. The structure and behaviour of each simulation model distributed by BioModels Database are thoroughly checked; in addition, model elements are annotated with terms from controlled vocabularies as well as linked to relevant data resources. Models can be examined online or downloaded in various formats. Reaction network diagrams generated from the models are also available in several formats. BioModels Database also provides features such as online simulation and the extraction of components from large scale models into smaller submodels. Finally, the system provides a range of web services that external software systems can use to access up-to-date data from the database.
BioModels Database has become a recognised reference resource for systems biology. It is being used by the community in a variety of ways; for example, it is used to benchmark different simulation systems, and to study the clustering of models based upon their annotations. Model deposition to the database today is advised by several publishers of scientific journals. The models in BioModels Database are freely distributed and reusable; the underlying software infrastructure is also available from SourceForge \url{https://sourceforge.net/projects/biomodels/} under the GNU General Public License.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Translating a known metabolic network into a dynamic model requires rate laws for all chemical reactions. The mathematical expressions depend on the underlying enzymatic mechanism; they can become quite involved and may contain a large number of parameters. Rate laws and enzyme parameters are still unknown for most enzymes. RESULTS: We introduce a simple and general rate law called "convenience kinetics". It can be derived from a simple random-order enzyme mechanism. Thermodynamic laws can impose dependencies on the kinetic parameters. Hence, to facilitate model fitting and parameter optimisation for large networks, we introduce thermodynamically independent system parameters: their values can be varied independently, without violating thermodynamical constraints. We achieve this by expressing the equilibrium constants either by Gibbs free energies of formation or by a set of independent equilibrium constants. The remaining system parameters are mean turnover rates, generalised Michaelis-Menten constants, and constants for inhibition and activation. All parameters correspond to molecular energies, for instance, binding energies between reactants and enzyme. CONCLUSION: Convenience kinetics can be used to translate a biochemical network--manually or automatically--into a dynamical model with plausible biological properties. It implements enzyme saturation and regulation by activators and inhibitors, covers all possible reaction stoichiometries, and can be specified by a small number of parameters. Its mathematical form makes it especially suitable for parameter estimation and optimisation. Parameter estimates can be easily computed from a least-squares fit to Michaelis-Menten values, turnover rates, equilibrium constants, and other quantities that are routinely measured in enzyme assays and stored in kinetic databases.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Standard rate laws are key prerequisites for systematically turning metabolic networks into kinetic models. They should provide simple, general, and biochemically plausible formulas for reaction velocities and elasticity coefficients. At the same time, they have to satisfy various thermodynamic relations that couple the kinetic and thermodynamic constants with the metabolic fluxes and concentrations.
Results: We present a family of reversible rate laws designed to describe reactions with arbitrary stoichiometries and various modes of regulation in a modular way. They include mass-action, Michaelis-Menten, and uni-uni reversible Hill kinetics as special cases. Thermodynamically consistent formulations of these rate laws ensure that the kinetic constants will satisfy the thermodynamic Wegscheider conditions and Haldane relationships, guaranteeing that parameter sets obtained from literature mining, fitting, sampling, or optimisation will lead to correct chemical equilibrium states. We show how the chemical potential differences act as a thermodynamic driving force and relate the modular rate laws to the thermodynamickinetic modelling formalism. A reformulation based on parameters called saturation values leads to simple formulas for elasticity and control coefficients, which reflect the role of thermodynamics. In one of the rate laws, the reaction rate directly depends on the reaction affinity, which therefore completely determines the entropy production. To simplify automatic processing of the modular rate laws, we propose a standard syntax and semantic annotations for the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). Availability: An online tool for inserting the rate laws into SBML is freely available at www.semanticsbml.org/sbmlfill.

  Abstract                 = {Facilitated by the development of high-throughput techniques, the focus of biological research has changed in the last decades from the investigation of single cell components to a system-level approach, which aims at an understanding of interactions between these cell components. This objective requires modeling and analysis methods for these regulatory networks. In this thesis, we investigate mechanisms causing qualitative dynamic behaviors of regulatory subsystems. For this purpose, we introduce a differential equation model based on underlying molecular binding reactions, whose parameters are estimated using time series concentration data. In the first part, the model is applied to subsystems with qualitatively different dynamic behaviors: The response of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis to DNA damages is described as the relaxation of a system to its steady state after external perturbation. Specific repression of genes in Escherichia coli by the global regulator protein H-NS is explained by the interrelation of feedback mechanisms. In order to prevent overfitting, a typical problem in network inference from experimental data, we introduce an approach based on Bayesian statistics, which includes prior knowledge about the system in terms of prior probability distributions. This approach is applied to simulated data and to the regulatory network of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle. Motivated by results on the yeast cell cycle, the second part of this thesis investigates the robustness of periodic behavior in regulatory networks. The model presented belongs to a class of differential equations whose solutions tend to converge to a steady state. Accordingly, periodic behavior is not robust with respect to parameter variations. We explain this phenomenon by applying a bifurcation analysis and investigating the stability of steady states. It is shown that large time scale differences and an inclusion of time-delays can stabilize sustained oscillations, and we postulate that they are important to maintain oscillations in biological systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Differential equations have been established to model the dynamic behavior of gene regulatory networks in the last few years. They provide a detailed insight into regulatory processes at a molecular level. However, in a top down approach aiming at the inference of the underlying regulatory network from gene expression data, the corresponding optimization problem is usually severely underdetermined, since the number of unknowns far exceeds the number of timepoints available. Thus one has to restrict the search space in a biologically meaningful way.
We use differential equations to model gene regulatory networks and introduce a Bayesian regularized inference method that is particularly suited to deal with sparse and noisy datasets. Network inference is carried out by embedding our model into a probabilistic framework and maximizing the posterior probability. A specifically designed hierarchical prior distribution over interaction strenghts favours sparse networks, enabling the method to efficiently deal with small datasets.
Results on a simulated dataset show that our method correctly learns network structure and model parameters even for short time series. Furthermore, we are able to learn main regulatory interactions in the yeast cell cycle.},

We introduce enhancements to the Evolutionary Algorithm optimization process to infer the parameters of the non-linear system given by the observed data more reliably and precisely. Due to the limited number of available data the inferring problem is under-determined and ambiguous.

However available methods are still not adequate in extraction of useful information about transcriptional regulation from these data. This study presents a dynamic model of gene expression which allows for identification of transcriptional regulators using time series of gene expression. The algorithm was applied for identification of transcriptional regulators controlling 40 cell cycle regulated genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The presented algorithm uses a dynamic model of time continuous gene expression with the assumption that the target gene expression profile results from the action of the upstream regulator. The goal is to apply the model to putative regulators to estimate the transcription pattern of a target gene using a least squares minimization procedure. The procedure iteratively tests all possible transcription factors and selects those that best approximate the target gene expression profile. Results were compared with independently published data and good agreement between the published and identified transcriptional regulators was found.},

Test regulatory networks generated with this approach display stable and cyclically stable gene expression levels, consistent with known biological systems. We include variables to model the effect of environmental conditions on transcription regulation and observed various alterations in gene expression patterns in response to environmental input. Finally, we use a derivation of this model system to predict the regulatory network from simulated input/output data sets and find that it accurately predicts all components of the model, even with noisy expression data.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The KEGG PATHWAY database provides a plethora of pathways for a diversity of organisms. All pathway components are directly linked to other KEGG databases, such as KEGG COMPOUND or KEGG REACTION. Therefore, the pathways can be extended with an enormous amount of information and provide a foundation for initial structural modeling approaches. As a drawback, KGML-formatted KEGG pathways are primarily designed for visualization purposes and often omit important details for the sake of a clear arrangement of its entries. Thus, a direct conversion into systems biology models would produce incomplete and erroneous models.
RESULTS: Here, we present a precise method for processing and converting KEGG pathways into initial metabolic and signaling models encoded in the standardized community pathway formats SBML (Levels 2 and 3) and BioPAX (Levels 2 and 3). This method involves correcting invalid or incomplete KGML content, creating complete and valid stoichiometric reactions, translating relations to signaling models and augmenting the pathway content with various information, such as cross-references to Entrez Gene, OMIM, UniProt ChEBI, and many more. Finally, we compare several existing conversion tools for KEGG pathways and show that the conversion from KEGG to BioPAX does not involve a loss of information, whilst lossless translations to SBML can only be performed using SBML Level 3, including its recently proposed qualitative models and groups extension packages. 
CONCLUSIONS: Building correct BioPAX and SBML signaling models from the KEGG database is a unique characteristic of the proposed method. Further, there is no other approach that is able to appropriately construct metabolic models from KEGG pathways, including correct reactions with stoichiometry. The resulting initial models, which contain valid and comprehensive SBML or BioPAX code and a multitude of cross-references, lay the foundation to facilitate further modeling steps.},

  Abstract                 = {The KEGG PATHWAY database provides a widely used service for metabolic and nonmetabolic pathways. It contains manually drawn pathway maps with information about the genes, reactions and relations contained therein. To store these pathways, KEGG uses KGML, a proprietary XML-format. Parsers and translators are needed to process the pathway maps for usage in other applications and algorithms. We have developed KEGGtranslator, an easy-to-use stand-alone application that can visualize and convert KGML formatted XML-files into multiple output formats. Unlike other translators, KEGGtranslator supports a plethora of output formats, is able to augment the information in translated documents (e.g. MIRIAM annotations) beyond the scope of the KGML document, and amends missing components to fragmentary reactions within the pathway to allow simulations on those.KEGGtranslator is freely available as a Java(™) Web Start application and for download at http://www.cogsys.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/software/KEGGtranslator/. KGML files can be downloaded from within the application.clemens.wrzodek@uni-tuebingen.deSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
