  <body>
    No rate equations were created because the model already contains a rate law for each reaction.
    By default, SBMLsqueezer does not overwrite already existing rate laws. However, you can 
    go back in this menu and select the option &#8220;For all reactions&#8221; in the box 
    &#8220;Genereate New  Kinetics&#8221;. This option protects you from deleting your rate equations
    by mistake. If you feel unsure of what to do, please click on the &#8220;Help&#8221; button
