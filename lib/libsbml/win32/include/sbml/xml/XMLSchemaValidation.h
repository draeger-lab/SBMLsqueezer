/**
 * Used by an SBMLReader to indicate the level of XML Schema validation.
 * Schema violations (for both BASIC and FULL) are reported in the
 * SBMLDocument's list of ParseMessages.  The levels are:
 *
 *   NONE (0) turns schema validation off.
 *
 *   BASIC (1) validates an XML instance document against an XML Schema.
 *   Those who wish to perform schema checking on SBML documents should use
 *   this option.
 *
 *   FULL (2) validates both the instance document itself *and* the XML
 *   Schema document.  The XML Schema document is checked for violation of
 *   particle unique attribution constraints and particle derivation
 *   restrictions, which is both time-consuming and memory intensive.
