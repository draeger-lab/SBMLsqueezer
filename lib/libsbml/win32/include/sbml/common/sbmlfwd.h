/**
 * Forward declaration of all opaque C types.
 *
 * Declaring all types up-front avoids "redefinition of type 'Foo'" compile
 * errors and allows our combined C/C++ headers to depend minimally upon
 * each other.  Put another way, the type definitions below serve the same
 * purpose as "class Foo;" forward declarations in C++ code.
