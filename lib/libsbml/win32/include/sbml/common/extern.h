/**
 * The following ifdef block is the standard way of creating macros which
 * make exporting from a DLL simpler. All files within this DLL are
 * compiled with the LIBSBML_EXPORTS symbol defined on the command line.
 * This symbol should not be defined on any project that uses this
 * DLL. This way any other project whose source files include this file see
 * LIBSBML_EXTERN functions as being imported from a DLL, wheras this DLL
 * sees symbols defined with this macro as being exported.
 *
 * (From Andrew Finney's sbwdefs.h, with "SBW" replaced by "LIBSBML" :)
