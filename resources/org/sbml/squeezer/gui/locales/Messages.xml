	This configuration describes the labels of buttons and menu items or 
	some important user messages in SBMLsqueezer-related graphical user interfaces.
	Although the preferred way would be to have separate key-value pairs for
	actual labels and their corresponding tooltips, you may want to use just 
	one key-value pair, in which the tooltip is located after the separator 
	";". Otherwise, please use the suffix "_TOOLTIP" to indicate a tooltip 
	for some label.
	
	Please see the JavaDoc for MessageFormatter and Formatter.
