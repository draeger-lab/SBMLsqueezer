	This configuration describes the labels of options in SBMLsqueezer-related 
	(graphical) user interfaces.
	Although the preferred way would be to have separate key-value pairs for
	actual labels and their corresponding tooltips, you may want to use just 
	one key-value pair, in which the tooltip is located after the separator 
	";". Otherwise, please use the suffix "_TOOLTIP" to indicate a tooltip 
	for some label.
	
	Please see the JavaDoc for MessageFormatter and Formatter.

  <entry key="POSSIBLE_ENZYME_MACROMOLECULE_TOOLTIP">If this options is selected, species that are annotated as macromolecules are treated as enzymes when catalyzing a reaction. Otherwise, macormolecule-catalyzed reactions are not considered enzyme reactions. If a modifier of a reaction that is annotated as an enzymatic catalyst refers to a macromolecule but this option is not active, SBMLsqueezer will reduce the modifier to a simple catalyst.</entry>
