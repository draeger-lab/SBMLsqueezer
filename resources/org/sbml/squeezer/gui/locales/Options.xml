	This configuration describes the labels of options in SBMLsqueezer-related 
	(graphical) user interfaces.
	Although the preferred way would be to have separate key-value pairs for
	actual labels and their corresponding tooltips, you may want to use just 
	one key-value pair, in which the tooltip is located after the separator 
	";". Otherwise, please use the suffix "_TOOLTIP" to indicate a tooltip 
	for some label.
	
	Please see the JavaDoc for MessageFormatter and Formatter.

  <!-- SqueezerOptions -->
  
  <entry key="SqueezerOptions">SBMLsqueezer Options</entry>
  
  <entry key="ALL_REACTIONS_AS_ENZYME_CATALYZED">Consider all reactions to be enzyme-catalyzed</entry>
  <entry key="ALL_REACTIONS_AS_ENZYME_CATALYZED_TOOLTIP">If true, all reactions within the network are considered to be enzyme-catalyzed reactions. If false (default), an explicit enzymatic catalyst must be assigned to a reaction to obtain this status.</entry>
  <entry key="DEFAULT_COMPARTMENT_SIZE">Default compartment initial size</entry>
  <entry key="DEFAULT_COMPARTMENT_SIZE_TOOLTIP">For compartments that are not yet initialized, SBMLsqueezer will use this value as the default initial size. By default this value is set to 1.0.</entry>
  <entry key="DEFAULT_NEW_PARAMETER_VAL">Default value of new parameters</entry>
  <entry key="DEFAULT_NEW_PARAMETER_VAL_TOOLTIP">Here you can specify the default value that is set for newly created parameters. By default this value is 1.0.</entry>
  <entry key="DEFAULT_SPECIES_HAS_ONLY_SUBSTANCE_UNITS">Species are quantities in substance units if not specified differently.</entry>
  <entry key="DEFAULT_SPECIES_HAS_ONLY_SUBSTANCE_UNITS_TOOLTIP">This option allows users to specify that the numerical value of a species should be interpreted as a value given in substance units in cases where this has not yet been defined. If not selected, species with undefined meaning will be conceived as a quantity in concentration units.</entry>
  <entry key="DEFAULT_SPECIES_INIT_VAL">Default species initial value</entry>
  <entry key="DEFAULT_SPECIES_INIT_VAL_TOOLTIP">If species are not yet initialized, SBMLsqueezer will use this value as initial amount or initial concentration of the species. Which kind of quantity is used, depends on whether the species has only substance units. This means, for species that are to be interpreted in terms of concentration, an initial concentration will be set, whereas an initial amount will be set if the species is to be interpreted in terms of molecule counts. By default this value is set to 1.0.</entry>
  <entry key="GENERATE_KINETIC_LAWS_FOR_ALL_REACTIONS">For all reactions</entry>
  <entry key="GENERATE_KINETIC_LAWS_FOR_ALL_REACTIONS_TOOLTIP">If this flag is set to true, a new rate law will be created for each reaction irrespective of whether there is already a rate law assigned to this reaction or not. If false (default), new rate laws are only generated if missing in the SBML file. Note that if this option is checked, already existing kinetic laws will be overwritten.</entry>
  <entry key="GENERATE_KINETIC_LAW_ONLY_IF_MISSING">Only when missing</entry>
  <entry key="GENERATE_KINETIC_LAW_ONLY_IF_MISSING_TOOLTIP">If checked, kinetics are only generated if missing in the SBML file.</entry>

Preselected are the KEGG compound identifiers for water and protons.</entry>

  <entry key="KINETICS_NONE_ENZYME_REACTIONS_TOOLTIP">Determines the key for the standard kinetic law to be applied for reactions that are catalyzed by non-enzymes or that are not catalyzed at all. The value may be any rate law that implements InterfaceNonEnzymeKinetics</entry>

  <entry key="MAX_NUMBER_OF_REACTANTS">Maximum number of reactants</entry>
  <entry key="MAX_NUMBER_OF_REACTANTS_TOOLTIP">A simultaneous collition of a high number of reactants just by chance is very unlikely. Usually, these reactions proceed in a sequence of separate steps, each involving only very few molecules. Here you can specifiy the maximal number of reactants so that the reaction is still considered plausible. By default this value is set to 3. Note that this option is only available if you decide that this kind of warning should be displayed.</entry>
  <entry key="NEW_PARAMETERS_GLOBAL">Add all new parameters globally</entry>
  <entry key="NEW_PARAMETERS_GLOBAL_TOOLTIP">"If true (default), all parameters are stored globally for the whole model. Otherwise the majoirty of parameters are stored locally for the respective kinetic equation they belong to. Note that some parameters represent global properties of the entire model and should therefore be always stored in the global list of prameters. In this way, these parameters are valid within the entire model.</entry>

Otherwise, macormolecule-catalyzed reactions are not considered enzyme reactions. If a modifier of a reaction that is annotated as an enzymatic catalyst refers to a macromolecule but this option is not active, SBMLsqueezer will reduce the modifier to a simple catalyst.</entry>

  <entry key="TYPE_UNIT_CONSISTENCY_TOOLTIP">This option ensures unit consistency and can attain two different values: Choose amount bring each occurance of a participating species to a substance unit. Depending on whether the species has only substance units or not it might be necessary to multiply the species with the size of its surrounding compartment. Choose concentration to bring each participating species to concentration units. In this case the species will be divided by the surrounding compartment size in a kinetic equations if it is defined to have only substance units. The units of parameters are set accordingly.</entry>
  <entry key="TYPE_UNITS_COMPARTMENT">Bring species to concentration units</entry>
