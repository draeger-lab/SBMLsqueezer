<h1>Release Notes of SBMLsqueezer version 2.0</h1>
<h2>Download of SBMLsquezeezer</h2>
You can always download the latest version of SBMLsqueezer at
<a
	href="http://www.cogsys.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/software/SBMLsqueezer/downloads">
http://www.cogsys.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/software/SBMLsqueezer/downloads</a>.

<h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li>SBMLsqueezer can now be used in several different ways:
      <ul>
        <li>As fully-featured stand-alone program without the need to install
            any further software, based on the official JSBML version
            1.0&#946;1</li>
        <li>As a stand-alone program based on a libSBML back-end, which means
            that real offline SBML validation is possible.</li>
        <li>Irrespective of whether JSBML or libSBML is used as SBML library,
            the stand-alone version provides both, a graphical user interface
            as well as a fully-featured command-line version. For large-scale
            rate law generation, this command-line interface has already proven
            to be useful (as part of the path2models project).</li>
        <li>SBMLsqueezer can be launched directly from the website
            <a href="http://www.cogsys.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/software/SBMLsqueezer/">www.cogsys.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/software/SBMLsqueezer/</a>
            as a Java&trade; Web Start program without the need of any local
            installation.</li>
        <li>As a plug-in for CellDesigner 4.3</li>
        <li>As a Garuda gadget, as which it can communicate with further
            Garuda gadgets</li>
      </ul>
      Hence, the usage of the program has been greatly simplified.
    <li>SBMLsqueezer fully supports all Levels and Versions of SBML up to the
        most recent specification Level 3 Version 1.</li>
    <li>A direct query wizard for SABIO-RK has been implemented and allows users
        to extract experimentally obtained rate laws from this database together
        with parameters, values, and units. The search engine provides several
        settings for experimental conditions.</li>
    <li>SBMLsqueezer includes now several JUnit test cases to check if the
        generated kinetic equations are correct.</li>
    <li>It includes now a full version of SBML2LaTeX and can directly open PDF
        files that are generated to document the content of the model.</li>
    <li>The renderer for equations and formula has been changed and provides
        more capabilities. SBMLsqueezer windows and context menus are now
        zoomable and resizable.</li>
	<li>Improved user preferences menu and management for each individual
	    operating system</li>
	<li>The graphical user interface is bilingual (German and English), but
	    models and their labels are only created in English for the sake of a
	    better international re-usability.</li>
	<li>A new search function allows users to query the model data structure in
	    the graphical user interface.</li>
	<li>Lots of effort has been put to better adapt SBMLsqueezer to individual
	    platforms. The support for Mac OS X has been greatly improved, the
	    program now provides many features of native apps for Mac OS.</li>
	<li>The documentation of the application programming interface (API) has
	    been improved.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The communication between SBMLsqueezer and CellDesigner was very
      inefficient. The new plugin interface in JSBML provides a much better
      performance.</li>
  <li>Errors in kinetic equations and units of parameters have been detected
      and solved:
    <ul>
      <li>Sometimes SBMLsqueezer created invalid identifiers for newly
          introduced units.</li>
      <li>The units of the association and dissociation constant in generalized
          mass action kinetics could not be derived correctly if a catalyst
          interfered with the reaction, because the units of the catalyst were
          not taken into account.</li>
      <li>The units of the half saturation constant in the (generalized) Hill
          equation were not correctly derived. The derivation of units of
          kinetic parameters has been improved</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Several minor issues with the graphical user interface have been
      solved.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Known Issues</h3>

In SBML models, it should be possible to evaluate all kinetic equations to
extend of reaction units per time units. Usually, the extend of a reaction would
be a variant of a substance unit. However, it has been recognized that some
kinetic equations cannot under all conditions be evaluated to extend per time
units. The reasons are often the structure of the definition of the rate law.
Some equations that have been defined for gene-regulatory networks, for
instance, give a purely phenomenological description of the system (e.g.,
S- or H-systems). In other equations, it is assumed that the equilibrium constant
is always dimensionless. If this is not the case, it cannot be guaranteed that
SBMLsqueezer will create correct units for these equations (e.g., modular rate
laws and convenience kinetics). It is therefore recommended to check the units
of generated rate laws, even if in the vast majority of cases these will be
correct. Please note that in this version the general unit handling has been
extensively revised and improved and is in the vast majority of cases very
reliable. SBMLsqueezer displays the derived units of equations, so that
problematic equations can be easily identified.
