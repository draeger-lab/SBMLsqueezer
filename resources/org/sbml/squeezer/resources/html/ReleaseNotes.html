<h3>Known Issues</h3>

In SBML models, it should be possible to evaluate all kinetic equations to
extend of reaction units per time units. Usually, the extend of a reaction would
be a variant of a substance unit. However, it has been recognized that some
kinetic equations cannot under all conditions be evaluated to extend per time
units. The reasons are often the structure of the definition of the rate law.
Some equations that have been defined for gene-regulatory networks, for
instance, give a purely phenomenological description of the system (e.g.,
S- or H-systems). In other equations, it is assumed that the equilibrium constant
is always dimensionless. If this is not the case, it cannot be guaranteed that
SBMLsqueezer will create correct units for these equations (e.g., modular rate
laws and convenience kinetics). It is therefore recommended to check the units
of generated rate laws, even if in the vast majority of cases these will be
correct. Please note that in this version the general unit handling has been
extensively revised and improved and is in the vast majority of cases very
reliable. SBMLsqueezer displays the derived units of equations, so that
problematic equations can be easily identified.
