    <h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
    
    <p>
      The units of the association and dissociation constant in generalized
      mass action kinetics could not be derived correctly if a catalyst interfered
      with the reaction, because the units of the catalyst were not taken into
      account.
    </p>
    <p>
      The units of the half saturation constant in the (generalized) Hill equation
      were not correctly derived.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In GUI, species tag was not visible for SimpleSpeciesReferences
      due to an incorrect positioning of the GUI element.
